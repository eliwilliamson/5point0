                            <p>DUSK is looking for a skilled interface designer to help us create digital products that people
                                love using. If you approach design with the intent to solve problems and you love shaping what
                                a product does – not just what it looks like – then you’ll love working at DUSK.</p>

                    <h2>What we’re looking for</h2>

                    <p>Kyle Steed said: “If you’re not solving a problem, you’re not designing.” At DUSK, we’re of the
                        opinion that designing is a process of distilling clarity. Design solves problems. Good design
                        solves problems elegantly. We’re looking for people who are as passionate about how their design
                        feels, performs and transacts with users, as they are about the way it looks.</p>
