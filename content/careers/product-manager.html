                    <h2>What we’re looking for</h2>

                    <p>Managing a product is a complex process. There are numerous moving pieces to manage: technology,
                        features, people, lists, deliverables and milestones. And somehow, in the end a product that
                        helps users get something done emerges. The process is somewhat a mystery, unless you’re the
                        kind of person we’re looking for.</p>
