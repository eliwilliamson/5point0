                        <h2>The challenge</h2>

                        <p>The Rawson website is in need of a redesign in order to evolve and improve with the existing
                            landscape. A few years ago we built an API for Rawson in order to make property and agent-related
                            information more accessible within the business. We also designed and built a responsive
                            website on top of that. Since then this structure has become outdated and over-complicated,
                            providing us with the opportunity to evolve both the structure and design into something
                            more sustainable and fresh.</p>

                        <h2>Creating sustainability</h2>

                        <p>We surfaced 3 main issues with the current website:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>The API structure was messy, over-complicated and needed an overhaul in order to rebuild something more sustainable on top.</li>
                            <li>The design was not created using a style guide, therefore new features and updates to the website were inconsistent, messy and took a lot more time than necessary.</li>
                            <li>The design style and user experience were outdated and needed a fresh approach in order to compete with modern standards.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Working together</h2>

                        <p>With these issues in mind, our team of back-end developers, front-end developers and designers
                            have been able to work simultaneously, allowing for more collaboration internally and a
                            like-minded goal for achieving the success both the client and us would like to see from
                            the launch of the new website. Watch this space!</p>
